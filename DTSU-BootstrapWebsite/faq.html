                  <b><u>What does a Virus do?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> Viruses range in what they can do and what they are meant to do. The first thing that classifies a program as a virus is they execute without the computer owners permission. This can allow the virus to corrupt or delete data which
                  the owner would not otherwise want or authorize the computer to do. The most extreme viruses can do anything from encrypt the whole computer to the point it is basically useless, and all the way to deleting all the data on a user’s hard
                  drive. Smarter viruses that are coded to replicate, tend to use common services like private email to spread itself to other unsuspecting users.
                  <br />
                  <hr style="border-color:#74c9be;" />
                  <b><u>How did I get the virus in the first place?!</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> Most malicious programs are commonly spread through email attachments and instant messages from friends or family without their explicit permission. While the previous statement is the most common way, programmers have found other
                  ways to trick unsuspecting users into not willingly downloading their malicious code. These ways can range from funny images someone finds on Google or are sent as attachments, digital cards, audio files, or even favorite videos. Another
                  very popular way of contracting viruses and other malicious programs is through illegitimate downloads from .torrent websites and online file converters.
                  <br />
                  <hr style="border-color:#74c9be;" />
                  <b><u>How can I avoid these pesky viruses you speak of?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> The most common and obvious way to prevent viruses is to turn on and update the anti-virus program. Dan's Tech Support Unlimited provides links to purchase our most trusted programs. Please visit the software page for links and
                  more information. Another way is to keep up to date with information on the latest viruses found on the internet and the signs of infection. A user should also avoid visiting websites which are out of their country, or otherwise foreign
                  to them unless they are 100% sure they are safe. As an added boost to the last statement, check the URL bar for redirects to other webpages which the user has not authorized the computer to go to. Examples of these redirects can be:
                  www.microsoft.help123.com. This is going to the domain help123.com with a subdomain of Microsoft. This is a common way malicious coders disguise their websites to steal data and force the user to download programs which they should not.
                  Lastly, the user should refrain from downloading attachments, emails, or other files which they are unsure of their entire origin.

                <b><u>What does a Trojans do?</u></b>
                <br />
                <br /> Trojans have two major tasks: Trojan viruses destroy/modify data, or they try to steal passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information. They are deliberately designed to be destructive and disruptive to a user, while
                not having the computer owner’s full explicit permission. Trojans as a whole cannot spread themselves, but they can use malicious code like worms to spread themselves to other areas of the computer, around the network, and to other users.
                <br />
                <br />
                <hr style="border-color:#74c9be;" />
                <b><u>Why is it called a Trojan?</u></b>
                <br />
                <br /> The name Trojan horse comes from ancient Greek mythology during the Trojan War. The Greek empire wanted to have control over The City of Troy, which was currently in the Trojans possession. The city was too well guarded and reinforced
                for a regular attack, so the Greeks had to come up with a plan a little more cunning and sneaky. They began building a large wooden horse, which had many hidden compartments for Greek soldiers to hide in. Upon completion, many soldiers
                were placed inside the horse, where they would hide for a long time. Then one night the Greeks wheeled the horse up to the gates of The City of Troy, and left it there for its unsusceptible enemies. The Trojans in surprise, inspected the
                horse to their best ability, but it obviously was not enough. They found the horse as a gift from an unknown source, and happily wheeled it into their city gates. That night, the Greeks emerged from the horse to surprise the citizens of
                Troy, which ultimately allowed the Greeks to take over the city indefinitely. Thus, the name Trojan horse was born, a sneaky way to infiltrate an unsuspecting victim. Presenting itself as one object (a safe program), but really being another
                (a harmful batch of code).

                        The main purpose to Backdoor Trojans is to allow the malicious programmer remote access to the infected computer. The author or otherwise authorized user of the Trojan can do anything they wish with the computer. This includes, but is not limited to,
                        sending, receiving, launching, and deleting files; displaying files or images, rebooting the computer or shutting it down. All of these actions can be done without the owner’s knowledge and in total secrecy. Most of the time, Backdoor
                        Trojans are used to unite groups of victim computer to form a botnet or zombie network, which is used for criminal activities like DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, insertion of key loggers, and other illegal operations.

                        malicious code. This mainly extends the time in which the malicious code can be active and run on the infected system.

                        Trojan-DDoS programs are usually used within botnets and zombie networks. These are dormant connections between computers that can be used to attack another network which the malicious programmer schedules to take down. Upon initiation of the DoS attack,
                        the botnet or zombie network "awakens" and starts trying to make connections to a specific website or server. With a zombie network large enough, an attacker has the power to take down networks as large as Sony, and Microsoft.
                        DoS attacks send multiple "requests", which are connections to a server or website, which with so many "requests" overwhelms the server and forces it to abort all connections, ultimately shutting the website/server down.

                        to be able to prevent the code from being detected by Anti-Virus and other combative programs (consult Trojan-Rootkit). These are used because not all Anti-Virus programs are able to scan all of the components inside this type
                        of Trojan, mainly because it would take up too much computer resources, and the user would not be likely to use their program anymore, ultimately losing profits.

                  <b><u>What does a Worm do?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> A Worm is a specific type of virus that propagates itself across many computer, usually by creating copies of itself in each infected computers memory. The weird thing about worms are, they are not always designed to cause harm
                  like other viruses, but can unintentionally cause problems. Also unlike viruses, worms do not infect other files, instead they replicate like rabbits within seconds. Once the worm is embedded in a computer’s memory or across a network,
                  it searches on that network to find other computers to infect. It will look for vulnerable computers that have not patched Operating System (OS) and application exploits in which it knows how to use to its advantage. The worm can scan
                  network resources using the local OS services. Along with OS/Application exploits, a worm can be proficient in finding problems in network configurations which it use to exploit errors and in turn embed itself. The other most strategic
                  way worms use to infect machines that are open to exploitation is by scanning the internet and sending data to machines in the form of packets or requests that contain worm downloaders or can install the work directly. If this method
                  succeeds, then the machine was vulnerable and it executes its payload, which effects the computer and starts to scan for more computers. Most worms use more than one exploitation method in order to have the highest possible chance of
                  replication and infection.
                  <hr style="border-color:#74c9be;" />
                  <b><u>What are the most common ways worms are spread?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> Worms are spread in many ways, some of which are automated and others rely on user mistake. These mistakes can cost a user dearly and induce a lot of stress, which can allow big name companies to force the user into tossing away
                  money that does not need to be. The first most common way a worm is spread from computer to computer is through email attachments. This can include Microsoft Outlook services, direct connections to SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
                  servers which use their own API (Application Program Interface), and through Windows MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) functions which most computers use to fetch data. Another popular way malicious programmers often
                  trick users into manually or unintentionally downloading and installing these viruses is through direct links to websites or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) resources. There is also a high usage of ICQ and IRC instant messaging programs
                  which allow these programs to be downloaded and installed with or without the user’s permission. Along with the common FTP resource methods, malicious programmers find flaws in P2P (Peer-to-Peer) file sharing resources. The other most
                  common and most likely the sneakiest form a malicious programmer can infiltrate an end users network is by sending network packets to the exploitable users computer and network. These directly penetrate the network and computer, activating
                  itself within the memory, and then spreading itself to cause more havoc to as many machines as it can find.
                  <hr style="border-color:#74c9be;" />
                  <b><u>When and how did worms first appear?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> The first worm developed reached a whole mess of havoc on unsuspecting victims overnight, but as it goes to show, was not developed to cause any of the harm that it did. According to its writer, Robert Morris of Cornell University,
                  it was written solely to gauge the size of the internet. The Morris Worm was released from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to disguise where it was actually created. Without going into too much technical mumbo jumbo, The
                  Morris Worm took advantage of early UNIX exploits and installed itself on the server itself. Caused by a flaw in the writer’s code, the worm would install itself not only once, but multiple times on each server and computer. This would
                  create a process for each time it was installed and run, taking up massive amounts of RAM (Random Access Memory) and CPU (Computer Processing Unit) power which in turn would crash the computer or on webservers take up so many system
                  resources the worm could be considered a DoS (Denial of Service) attack shutting down the webserver and causing critical damage. The worm infected almost ever Sun-3 and VAX system connected to the internet, which the United States Government
                  Accountability Office released a damage sum of $100,000 - $10,000,000 damage total. It was estimated that 6,000 UNIX based computers were effected. The Morris Worm was the first worm to draw major media attention and cause a significant
                  amount of damage.

                  <b><u>What does Spyware do?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> Spyware is a special type of malware that preforms certain actions in which classify it in a different category called spyware. Spyware is specifically designed to be hard to find, and once found, be difficult to remove. Most
                  programs are also designed with redundancy in mind, where if a user removes a spyware item, on start up a service will download the spyware and re-infect the computer. Spyware is also designed to revert any changed that user or technician
                  may make in an effort to remove or halt the spyware program. Once the program is initially installed, the software can download advertisements that can overlay webpages as well as other programs. Another common feature seen as a result
                  of spyware is changes in the configuration of the user’s computer or internet browser. The scariest part about spyware programs, they can send data back to the original developer. This includes internet habits, personal information,
                  and even login information, but there are many ways to stop this.
                  <hr style="border-color:#74c9be;" />
                  <b><u>How did I contract this nuisance program called Spyware?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> Spyware programs can be acquired in many similar ways as other forms of harmful programs can be. One way most programmers sneak their spyware programs onto helpless victims computers is by inserting it within legitimate programs,
                  then redistributing those infected programs to install on the consumers computer spreading the program. While a spyware program is harvesting someone’s email addresses, it may come across a friend and send an email to another computer
                  user, which can redirect a user to a webpage which can automatically install the spyware program. There are also install links on the internet, weather they pose to be legitimate copies of programs, free copies of paid programs, or torrent
                  downloads, they can still comprise of spyware software within them, or worse have more dangerous software inside them. This will lead us into how to prevent these situations.
                  <hr style="border-color:#74c9be;" />
                  <b><u>So tell me already, how do I try to prevent these Spyware programs?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> There are a few way someone can prevent and combat spyware programs. The first, most common, and easiest way to prevent spyware is to install an anti-virus program and let it actively protect the computer. Anti-virus programs
                  are intended to prevent and disinfect or remove files that contain viruses, but in fact include tools that defend and prevent malicious, network, and spyware attacks. On the software page, there are lists of products which can protect
                  a computer from Spyware. Another, slightly less recommended way to combat malware is to use a program specifically designed to combat spyware, appropriately names anti-spyware. This is not as highly recommended because multiple security
                  scanners on a computer can actually lead to gaps in security due to the overlay of protection layers these programs put in place. Logically, multiple programs overlaying each other’s protection layer seems like a good idea, but works
                  in reverse and creates gaps which spyware can easily squeeze its way through. The last, most sophisticated way is not a way to prevent spyware, but it is a way to prevent spyware from sending personal information back to its original
                  developer or third party information collectors. This method involves setting up the firewall to monitor outgoing messages, and not allow anything which may contain sensitive data. This is a possible way to prevent spyware from communicating,
                  but at the same time for the average end user, this is not a viable or worthy use of time. Remember, visit the Dan's Tech Support Unlimited Software page to view a list of programs that can help combat these major problems.

                  <b><u>What is Adware?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> Adware is a malicious and annoying form of computer programming that is designed to advertise products and services to users against their will. Adware can be anything from a banner on a webpage, a box with an advertisement, and
                  overlaying images or text. The key to what separates Adware from advertisements is that Adware is not designed into the webpages the user is trying to access. Adware is designed maliciously in order to advertise a product or service
                  for "free" and are usually a large nuisance. While sometimes there are situations in which web developers mistake one devices ability to comprehend code, which could turn into a bug which appears to be an infection of Adware, it is unlikely,
                  and when someone sees these pop ups or problems, they should consult a technician as Adware can leave holes for larger and more treturous issues.
                  <hr style="border-color:#74c9be;" />
                  <b><u>How did I get this Adware?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> Adware is usually secretly built into programs which most users should not be downloading or installing on their computers. Programs that advertise to be completely free, without advertisements or any source or revenue for the
                  company distributing it is usually not a program which the user should install. While there are programs which are freely distributed and are totally legitimate, there are more not legitimate programs that are totally free. These programs
                  find tricky ways to disguise and suppress the malicious adware programs which they contain. Sometimes you may not notice an issue until days after the installation of the infected program. The developers purposely build in these adware
                  programs as their form of revenue into these freeware programs described before. Another way some users get these programs is after the infection of a Trojan. The Trojan, being able to take control of the computer, can remotely download
                  the adware or even a more serious malicious program.
                  <hr style="border-color:#74c9be;" />
                  <b><u>So what does most Adware do and how can i prevent it?</u></b>
                  <br />
                  <br /> As explained before, Adware can do a broad range of tasks, but mainly it tracks the user’s habits on infected computers and delivers advertisements that it believes the user may like to see. Usually these advertisements are done
                  in a way which is a nuisance to the user who is trying to view a legitimate website. These tasks mainly take place in websites, which gives the task an appropriate name of "browser hijacking." These browser hijackers can redirect incorrectly
                  types website addresses to dangerous and malicious webpages. This can ultimately cause more damage to the user’s computer by automatically installing malicious programs the user most likely does not want on their computer. These browser
                  hijackers can also change settings within the browser including your favorites, homepages, and proxy configuration. Another dangerous form of adware can redirect any web searches to pay-to-view or pornographic websites, which the user
                  is most likely not trying to reach. Good preventative ways to stop these kinds of malicious programs can include making sure the local anti-virus system is always up to date. You can also make sure your internet browser is always up
                  to date, because often there are updates released in order to add security layers and help prevent the end user from having issues. Lastly, remember if you see signs of this harmful programs, get technical assistance as soon as possible.
