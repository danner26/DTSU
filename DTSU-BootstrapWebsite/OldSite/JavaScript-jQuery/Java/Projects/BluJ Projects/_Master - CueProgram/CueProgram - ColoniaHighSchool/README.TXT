Cue List Hassle Saver
Copyright (C) 2014 Daniel W. Anner

A basic cue program to allow Stage Managers and others to record and run cues more efficently.

== Description ==

This program allows the stage managers or other users to write down their cues to be run. Customization allows for one to 
write their own cue numbers in order, as well as their own cue descriptions. The view box can be adjusted to whatever size
the user would like, but it's default is on open. You can double click on the cue details to change the details if you entered
an error or as it very often happens, change the cue order. You are also able to remove cues from anywhere in the list, as well
as the top of the list down. Now you may question, after I write my hundreds of cues, how do i recover them after I run my show?
This is very simple. You can click the save button, and you will be presented with an option to save the details and numbers seperatly,
but in your own place and name. You can also click no to save it to the default location, which is in the local C: drive under cueDetails.txt
and cueNums.txt. Lastly, you can reload these cues, and if you saved them in a different location or under a different name, you can click yes to
choose a custom location and drill down until you find it. If you have saved it with the default by clicking no, then you can just hit no to
auto select the default files.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. If you have the proper Java files installed, you should be able to double click on Cue.java and it will run
	1a. If it does not run, go to Oracle's website and download the latest Java update, and if it still does not work, try downloading Java JRE
	1b. If that fails, attempt installing Java JDK from Oracle's website. If this fails, uninstall all Java and once it is, reinstall it one by one again
