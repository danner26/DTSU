                <p><b style="font-weight: 800; font-size: x-large;"><u>First "Computer" - The Z1 </u></b><br /></p>
                <b><p id="myResult"></p></b>
                <p>
                     Computers in the 20th century are a lot different than the ones we know and use daily. The first computer to was designed between 1935-36 and constructed between 1936-38. Konrad Zuse entierly designed and built the Z1 in his parents house, specifically the bathroom. The original name was the "V1" or the VursuchsMedell 1
                which translates to experimental model 1; but after World War 1 the machine was renames to prevent confusion with the widely known V1 rockets. This machine was the first to use Boolean Logic, and binary floating numbers, but was highly unreliable as they were never perfected. The only eletric part of the Z1 was the eletric motor 
                which produced a clock frequency of 1Hz. Unfortunatly, the Z1 was destroyed in December 1943 because of the bombing of Berlin during World War 2 along with all of the construction plans.

                <p><b style="font-weight: 800; font-size: x-large;"><u>First Eletric Computer - The ENIAC</u></b><br /></p>
                <b><p id="myResult1"></p></b>
                <p>     The first eletric computer was contracted, designed and produced starting on June 5, 1943. While in development at the University of Pennsilvania, the project was named "Project PX." The total cost of the computer was approximatly $500,000 dollars, which roughly translates to 6 million dollars today.
                The original designers were John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, both professors at Penn University. After development, the computer was named ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). The press promptly created their own nickname for the machine, calling it the "Great Brain." The main purpose of 
                the ENIAC was to calculate artillery firing tables for the US Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. The ENIAC weighed more than 30 tons, roughly 8 x 3 x 100 feet, which took up 1800 square feet and consumes 150 kW of power. This huge machine was capable of around 5,000 simple addition/subtraction, 385 multiplication, 40 division and 3 square root problems per second.
                 Amazingly, the first hydrogen bomb statistics were ran on the ENIAC, which produced 1 million cards. The machine was shut down on October 2, 1955. On the 65th anniversary, in the year 2011, the City of Philadelphia declared Febuary 15th "The ENIAC Day."

                <p><b style="font-weight: 800; font-size: x-large;"><u>First Personal Computer - Kenbak-1</u></b><br /></p>
                <b><p id="myResult2"></p></b>
                <p>     Before late 1971, computers were not used for personal use. Mostly, if not all computers were used for business and mathematical purposes. The first personal computer did not contain a microprocessor, which makes todays computers run at lightning speeds, while being smaller than an iPhone (remember, iPhone's contain multiple microprocessors). 
                There is no precise record of who created the first personal computer, but The Computer History Museum conducted a survey, which returned The Kenbak-1.There were only a total of 40 built and sold, which was a large amount for a home developer. Now a days, we can achieve around, and up to 40 TB (Terabyte) of memory in one computer! 
                Most machines in today’s day and age average 500 - 850 GB of memory. The Kenbak-1 only had an available 256 bytes of memory! That would not even be large enough to hold a simple text file with 500 words. Amazingly, the first prototype is still in operation today (as of 2005).

                <p><b style="font-weight: 800; font-size: x-large;"><u>Apple's First Computer - Apple-1</u></b><br /></p>
                <b><p id="myResult3"></p></b>
                <p>     Apple is now known for their extensive line of iPhone's, iPods, and Mac's. Some owners of Apples products do not know the history behind the company they invest hundreds of dollars in. Apples original owners were Steve Wozniak, Ron Wayne, and the very well known, Steve Jobs.
                Little known fact is Ron Wayne actually sold his share of the company back to the others, right before the release of their first computer. Before he left, he wrote Apple's first computer operation manual. Their computer was named, Apple-1. While Wayne wrote the manual, Wozniak developed the first printed circuit board, and Jobs did what he did best, advertised.
                They worked in development for many years, finally releasing it on April 11, 1976. The first Apple-1 was sold for $666.66, cleverly thought of by Jobs himself. Now a days, this computer would cost roughly $2,800.00. Just as the Kenbak-1, these machines ran at very low speeds compared to the blazing fast computers we are used to today. Not long after, the Apple-2 was released, with many improvements which started to pave the way to modern day computers.
