                <p class="Enlarge"><b style="font-weight: 800; font-size: x-large;"><u>Viruses</u></b><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">Okay, so first off what is a virus? <br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">There are two classifications for a virus: Macro Viruses and Worms.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">In addition, it is in most cases a program that is hidden within other seemingly harmless programs and <b>DOES NOT</b> produce copies of itself.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge"><b>Macro Viruses :</b><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">A Macro virus in simple terms, is a piece of malicious code embedded into a data file, AKA Macro. Most of these viruses are alike and these types of viruses are the most common.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge"><b>Worms :</b><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">These little buggers are computer programs that <b>DO</b> reproduce copies of themselves and often contain malicious functions that interfere with the normal computing process. These types of viruses fit more into the Trojan category, but are technically still viruses because they <b>DO NOT</b> attach themselves to other programs. <br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge"><b>Precautions for Viruses :</b><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">Be cautious when opening E-mails from senders that you know or do not know, downloaded files that are not 100% guaranteed safe, and unknown webpages or pop-ups. Make sure your pop-up blocker <b>IS</b> enabled at all times.<br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">Use the proper security settings (Ask DTSU for help if needed), as well as keep anti-virus databases up-to-date. Lastly keep internet and E-mail programs up-to-date, and your Operating System.<br /><br /><br /></p>
                
                <p class="Enlarge"><b style="font-weight: 800; font-size: x-large;"><u>Spyware</u></b><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">So, exactly what is Spyware you may ask ? <br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">Spyware is a program secretly placed on a computer to collect personal information and delivers it to advertisers or third party groups interested in the information. A spyware program can be injected into your computer as a result of a virus or a new install. We all can admit to clicking past install screens to "Speed up the process".<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">According to PestPatrol, a spyware removal company, there are over 78,000 spyware programs on the loose today. These include adware applications that track browsing history and server ads; key loggers which record keystrokes like passwords and credit card information; etc.. Webroot Software developers believe over 80 percent of computers around today have some sort of Spyware program installed in them.<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">Some of the most common spyware programs today include, but not limited to: Gator, BargainBuddy, BDE, and Bonsai Buddy.<br /><br /><br /></p>

                <p class="Enlarge"><b style="font-weight: 800; font-size: x-large;"><u>Trojans</u></b><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">So again we are presented with the all important question, What is a Trojan? <br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">A Trojan is a program that commits an undocumented and unwanted act on the computer. Trojans have the ability to multiply like rabbits and infect the computer as a whole.  These programs commit the following acts: Deleting data, Blocking data, Modifying data, Copying data, and disrupting the performance of the computer or network. Trojans are classified by how they impact your computer.<br /><br /></p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Backdoor</b><br />Backdoor Trojans give users remote access to the infected computer. They enable the author to do anything they wish, including: sending, receiving, launching and deleting files, displaying data, and rebooting the computrer. Often these types of Trojans are used to unite a group of victim computers to form a botnet or zombie network to be used for criminal activities.</li>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Exploit</b><br />Exploit Trojans contain data or code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities within application software running on your computer.</li>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Rootkit</b><br />Rootkit Trojans are used to conceal certain objects or activities in your system. Their main purpose is to often prevent malicious programs from being detected; in order to extend the time those programs can be run on a computer.</li>

                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Trojan-Downloader</b><br />These Trojans can download and install malicious programs onto your computer, including other Trojans and Spyware.</li>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Trojan-Dropper</b><br />Trojan-Dropper's are used by hackers to install Torjans or Viruses, or even to prevent detection of malicious programs/code. Not all anti-virus programs are capable of scanning all the components inside this type of Trojan.</li>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Trojan-FakeAV</b><br />Trojan-FakeAV programs simulate anti-virus software. They are designes to get money from you, in return detection and removal of threats; even though reported threats are non existant.</li>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Trojan-GameThief</b><br />Trojan-GameThief programs steal online gamers information.</li>

                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Trojan-Ransom</b><br />Trojan-Ransom programs modify data on your computer so the computer does not run correctly or you cannot use specific data. The criminal will only restore your computers performance or unblock the data after you pay them ransom money, usually through a service called BitCoins.</li>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Trojan-SMS</b><br />Trojan-SMS programs cost you money by sending text messages from your mobile device to premium rate phone numbers.</li>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Trojan-Spy</b><br />Trojan-Spy programs spy on how you use your computer, by tracking data you enter on your keyboard, taking screen shots, and getting lists of running applications.</li>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Trojan-Mailfinder</b><br />Trojan-MailFinder are used to "harvest" E-mail addresses from your computer.</li>
                    <li class="Enlarge"><b>Other types of Troajns</b><br />
                        <ol class="Enlarge">

                <p class="Enlarge"><b style="font-weight: 800; font-size: x-large;"><u>Malware</u></b><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">Last question, but certainly not least, What is Malware?<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">Malware is a distinctive program run on computers that alters the way the computer operates without the users knowledge or permission. <br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge"><b>How :</b><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">In the past, the majority of Malware programs were contracted from Media Sharing websites as well as portable devices such as CD ROM's, USB drives, etc.<br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">Nowadays Malware and other malicious programs/code is transferred through E-mail messages in the form of a weblink or file attachment offering an incentive. Don't underestimate downloads though, malicious files are infact transferred when downloading your favorite song or video. Other ways include a totally oblivious method called ONC (Over Network Connection).<br /><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge"><b>Symptoms :</b><br /></p>
                <p class="Enlarge">Some Malware disables your internet, alters data files, wipes the hard drive, or turns your computer into a useless hunk of metal. Malware can command your Operating System, "reproduce" in a sense, deny access,  and display weird text, graphics or audio. Possibly the Malware could be a "silent devil" with no completely obvious signs.<br /><br /></p>
